# ThreadUtilities

A library with thread utilities.

# Installation

The installation and build is tested on *ubuntu24.04 LTS*

## dependencies

googletest:

```bash
# create a directory where you like to clone googletest, eg: ~/Repos and change to it
mkdir ~/Repos ; cd ~/Repos
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
cd googletest
mkdir build
cd build
mkdir build
cmake ..
make -j $(nproc)
sudo make install
```

## use cmake to install the library

```bash
# change the next line to change the install prefix to your liking
INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
mkdir ./build
cd build
cmake -Wno-dev -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_PREFIX} ..
cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)
sudo cmake --install .
```

This will install the headers from the include-folder to `${INSTALL_PREFIX}/dkyb`

To use the headers in your code, make sure that ${INSTALL_PREFIX} is in the include directories of your project.
Include the file in your code e.g:

```c++
#include <dkyb/threadutil.h>
```
